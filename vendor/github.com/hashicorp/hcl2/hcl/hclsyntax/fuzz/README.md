# hclsyntax fuzzing utilities

This directory contains helper functions and corpuses that can be used to
fuzz-test the `hclsyntax` parsers using [go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz).

To fuzz, first install go-fuzz and its build tool in your `GOPATH`:

```
$ make tools
```

Now you can fuzz one or all of the parsers:

```
$ make fuzz-config FUZZ_WORK_DIR=/tmp/hcl2-fuzz-config
$ make fuzz-expr  FUZZ_WORK_DIR=/tmp/hcl2-fuzz-expr
$ make fuzz-template  FUZZ_WORK_DIR=/tmp/hcl2-fuzz-template
$ make fuzz-traversal FUZZ_WORK_DIR=/tmp/hcl2-fuzz-traversal
```

In all cases, set `FUZZ_WORK_DIR` to a directory where `go-fuzz` can keep state
as it works. This should ideally be in a ramdisk for efficiency, and should
probably _not_ be on an SSD to avoid thrashing it.

## Understanding the result

A small number of subdirectories will be created in the work directory.

If you let `go-fuzz` run for a few minutes (the more minutes the better) it
may detect "crashers", which are inputs that caused the parser to panic. Details
about these are written to `$FUZZ_WORK_DIR/crashers`:

```
$ ls /tmp/hcl2-fuzz-config/crashers
7f5e9ec80c89da14b8b0b238ec88969f658f5a2d
7f5e9ec80c89da14b8b0b238ec88969f658f5a2d.output
7f5e9ec80c89da14b8b0b238ec88969f658f5a2d.quoted
```

The base file above (with no extension) is the input that caused a crash. The
`.output` file contains the panic stack trace, which you can use as a clue to
figure out what caused the crash.

A good first step to fixing a detected crasher is to copy the failing input
into one of the unit tests in the `hclsyntax` package and see it crash there
too. After that, it's easy to re-run the test as you try to fix it. The
file with the `.quoted` extension contains a form of the input that is quoted
in Go syntax for easy copy-paste into a test case, even if the input contains
non-printable characters or other inconvenient symbols.

## Rebuilding for new Upstream Code

An archive file is created for `go-fuzz` to use on the first run of each
of the above, as a `.zip` file created in this directory. If upstream code
is changed these will need to be deleted to cause them to be rebuilt with
the latest code:

```
$ make clean
```
